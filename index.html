//a server will give you a string, its your job to turn it into a javascript object so you can access the thing
//one way to do this is to wrap it in a json .parse like so
// JSON.parse(data)
// not all websites will allow you to parse

const endpoint = "http://www.recipepuppy.com/api/";
//an endpoint is the url that you need to visit in order to get the data
